                        <p> Our knowledge of the world is very much based on what challenges and experiences that we have faced as we contiunue to grow on this journey of life. I have been grateful to have been put on this earth to learn about its many differnces and unique aspects. Having been on this planet for 20 years, I have developed my own philosphy about life, that is compelety unique to anyone that has the chance to read this. I will explain how I view the world in my attempt to be as clearful and consise as possible. This is about the first time I have truly tried to explain my beliefs in a way that others can understand, so I hope it goes well.</p>
                        
                        <p> My main outlook on life is that I believe that we should all focus on what we enjoy as indivdiuals and use the talents that God has given us to the best to our ability. I think that we too often get caught up in conforming to what others around us are doing, instead of focusing on ourselves and doing what we truly believe will better our lives and make us happy. We may fear to be the person that stands out or is different from those around us. We are scared of being judged for things that make us unique and special. A lot of us may constantly worry about what those around us are thinking about us, despite there being no repercussions to what they perceive. These worries can lead to falsifies in our lives. We may developed traits that truly aren't us and can hinder what is actually meant to shine through.  I like to think that I have done a good job at doing what I truly enjoy, without letting outside influecne have to much of an effecetive on me. Jon Kabat-Zinn discuss points about how important knowing about ourselves is. He stated, "By investigating inwardly our own nature as beings and, particularly, the nature of our own minds through careful and systematic self-observation, we may be able to live lives of greater satisfaction, harmony, and wisdom."  </p>
                        <p>If we able to let go of our concerns based around what those around us think, we will grow and fullfill our true potential. We will see our social anxietys and stress melt away and we can let happiness and joy take their place. Simon Biles discussed the importance of man developing indivdual traits, he stated "We do not obtain the most precious gifts by going in search of them but by waiting for them. Man cannot discover them by his own powers, and if he sets out to seek for them he will find in their place counterfeits of which he will be unable to discern the falsity." In order to become what we are truly destined to be, we need to focus on growing ourselves and following our hearts desires.</p>
